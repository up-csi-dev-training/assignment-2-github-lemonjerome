In the sizzling heart of the kitchen's embrace,
Where flavors dance in a fiery chase,
A culinary magic takes its stand,
Crafting a dish both bold and grand

Sisig, oh symphony of sizzling delight,
A Filipino treasure, a culinary flight
From humble beginnings, it rose to fame,
A melody of textures, a gastronomic claim

Pork's crispy symphony, a crunchy song,
On the palate, a savory dance lifelong
Sizzling on the grill, a harmonious blend,
As onions and chilies their flavors send

Citrus notes join the sizzle's refrain,
Calamansi whispers, cutting through like rain
A symphony of tastes, a crescendo so sweet,
Sisig, a masterpiece, a culinary feat

Chopped and mingled, a medley profound,
In the skillet's embrace, flavors unbound
A chorus of textures, a crunch and a savor,
A culinary anthem, a dish to savor

From Pampanga's heart, it made its way,
Across archipelagos, a culinary display
Sisig, a celebration, a feast on the plate,
A testament to tradition, a culinary fate

In gatherings and fiestas, it takes the stage,
A culinary icon, a timeless engage
Spicy and bold, a taste that endures,
Sisig, a tale of Filipino flavors

So raise your forks to this sizzling delight,
A dish that ignites every appetite
In the realm of cuisine, it proudly stands,
Sisig, the heartbeat of Filipino lands
